# LLM Interview 

There are 2 versions of this program: a Streamlit version (better-looking), and a Tkinter version (ugly, but more immersive) (still not that immersive though)

## Install

Python 3.11 is required (some older versions may also work)
`pip install -r requirements`

You also need to copy-paste the `.env.dist` file to `.env`, and add your personal API key.

## Launch

To launch the Tkinter version: launch script `interface.py` in folder `tkinter`

To launch the Streamlit version: `streamlit run testing_tts.py` in directory `streamlit`

## Dummy files

Dummy job offer, resume and motivation letter can be found in directory `dummies`, in both PDF and raw text format.
